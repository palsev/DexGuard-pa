  "the_problem_text_P1": "Each and every trade you submit through a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) is vulnerable to front-running and sandwich attacks – though the larger the transaction, the larger the risk of an attack.",
  "the_problem_text_P2": "To execute these attacks, front-runners monitor the publicly visible mempool (pending transactions) using bots that hunt for transactions to attack. Once a bot locks in on your transaction, it executes the front-running attack by slightly outbidding your gas fee, incentivizing the miner to validate the attacker’s transaction before yours.",
  "the_problem_text_P3": "Now that you’ve been cut in line by the attacker’s bots, their transaction gets executed before yours, leaving you with a worse exchange rate than you deserve.",
